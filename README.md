## Installation

1.  **Download the Tool:**
    You can download the latest version of the tool directly as a ZIP file here:
    [Download MetaMask Data Decompressor (ZIP)](https://github.com/0xLuigi/metamask-data-decompresor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    After downloading, extract the contents to a folder of your choice.

2.  **Prepare Your MetaMask Data File:**
     Open the folder where you extracted the tool. Then, copy your MetaMask vault data file (the numbered file you located using the instructions above) into this same   folder.

3.  **Ensure Python is Installed:**
    This tool requires Python 3. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4.  Install the **cryptography** package, which is required for decryption functionality:
     ```bash
    pip install cryptography
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you placed the tool and your MetaMask data file, and run the application:
    ```bash
    python mm_decomp.py
    ```
    This will launch the graphical user interface (GUI).

 ## Usage

Once the application is running:

* The tool should automatically detect your MetaMask vault file if it's located in the same directory as the `mm_decomp.py` script.
* Click the **"Decompress"** button.
* Within a few seconds, your file will be processed and saved as a text file named `[original_file_name]_decompressed.txt` in the same directory.
* If the program finds your MetaMask vault data, it will display it in the "MetaMask Vault Data" text area after the decompression and search are complete.
* You can also optionally enter an Ethereum (ETH) address in the "Search ETH Address" field. The program will search for this address within the decompressed content, helping you confirm if it's the correct file.

## Decrypting Your Vault Data

After successfully extracting your MetaMask vault data using this decompressor, you can proceed to decrypt it to recover your seed phrase (secret recovery phrase).

### Option 1: Official MetaMask Vault Decryptor
- Download the Official MetaMask Vault Decryptor:
  Get the official decryptor tool from MetaMask's GitHub repository:
  [https://github.com/MetaMask/vault-decryptor](https://github.com/MetaMask/vault-decryptor)
- Extract the Decryptor: Unzip the downloaded `vault-decryptor-master.zip` file to a convenient location, such as your desktop.
- Open the Decryptor: Navigate to the extracted `vault-decryptor-master` folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Use Your Decompressed Vault Data: Follow the instructions provided on the `index.html` page to use the MetaMask vault data you extracted with this tool. You will typically paste the JSON vault data into the decryptor to proceed with recovering your seed phrase.

### Option 2: Try My Vault Data Decryptor (Python Version)
Alternatively, you can use my custom Python-based Vault Data Decryptor, which is integrated with this tool:
- After decompressing your vault data and seeing it in the "MetaMask Vault Data" text area, click the "Decrypt MetaMask Data" button. This will launch the Python version of the decryptor.
- The decryptor will open a GUI where you can paste the vault data (if needed) and enter your password to decrypt and recover your seed phrase.
- Ensure the `vault_decryptor.py` script is in the same directory as `mm_decomp.py`, and that the `cryptography` package is installed (see Installation steps above).
